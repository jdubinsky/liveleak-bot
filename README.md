# liveleak-bot
My friend Jacob and I have this friend Matt. Matt seriously sends us liveleak links like 30 times a day. We only look at these links about 1/20 times, and every time we do we seriously regret it. This project is a bot that parses incoming messages on facebook, and automatically sends a message to the sender if the bot detects a liveleak link.
